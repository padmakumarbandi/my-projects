Assignment - 1

All most 95% of the required work is covered in our training, I added extra 5% of extra work for which you have to refer documentation.
Let me know if you have any questions.

Theory

1) List out few iOS apps that you use most? And also list why you like the app most?
2) What is a Native app? Give some examples?
3) What are two programatic paradigms we discussed? Give examples?
4) What does `NS` stands for?
5) Explain the following
	1) Class
	2) Object
	3) Parameter
	4) Function
	5) Value Type & Reference Type

6) Explain the difference between COCOA & COCOA-TOUCH Frameworks?
7) What are different layers in COCOA_TOUCH Framework? Explain each layer with examples?
8) Explain the lifecycle of an iOS APPlication with diagram?
9) Explain the following classes
	1) NSObject
	2) NSArray
	3) NSDictionary
	4) NSString
	5) NSSet

10) List out some commonly used UIElements?

11) Explain about AppDelegate file? And What is the importance of AppDelegate?
12) List out some methods available in AppDelegate? And explain why they are used?


Project

1) Create a new Single View application and name it as `Assignment1` with language Objective-C.
2) Organize the project files into different groups.
3) Open `AppDelegate.m` file and inside `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptins:` method do the following
	1) Create the following immutable objects
		1) NSString
			1) Create a two new strings.(in two ways as we discussed)
			2) Print out the length of the strings
			3) Print the strings in uppercase and lowercase
			4) Compare strings and print out if they are equal or not equal
			5) Combine two strings
			6) Create a new string `LastName,FirstName`. Divide this string into two strings using comma as delimiter.
			7) Create a new string `Hello How are you?`. Find the substring `How` from the string.
			8) Using the above string replace `How are you?` with `World`. So the final string will be `Hello World`.
			9) Format the strings and print them.
						
		2) NSArray
			1) Create two arrays with objects. First array with `numbers`(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) and 
				second one with `strings` (apple, ball, cat, dog, egg, fan, grapes)
			2) From the numbers array find if number `8` exists or not.
			3) From the strings array find the index of `apple` string.
			4) Create two identical arrays, use appropriate method to Compare arrays and find out if they are same or different.
			5) Using the arrays above derive a new array.
			6) Loop through the arrays and prints values
		3) NSDictionary
			1) Use dictionaries and repeat the Array steps.
		4) NSSet
			1) Use sets and repeat the Array steps.
			
	2) For Mutable Objects refer to documentation and do interesting things (your choice).

4) Demonstrate the concept of inheritance by creating Parent and Child classes.
5) Create appropriate properties and Instance variables for parent and child classes.
6) Create default initializers and designated initializers to set values for IVar's created above.
7) Demonstrate the concept of method overriding between Parent and Child classes.
8) Create objects for Parent and Child classes to access the Ivar's, Properties and methods (use `viewDidLoad:` method in ViewController for creating objects).
   Refer to the projects & Videos uploaded on to drive.
